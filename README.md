# Simple ChatBot

A straightforward Java chatbot created as my second project on the Hyperskill platform. This bot is designed to help me learn Java and familiarize myself with basic programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and user interactions.

## Features
- Greets and interacts with the user.
- Calculates age based on user-provided remainders.
- Counts to a number specified by the user.
- Conducts a simple programming quiz.

## Running the Project
To run this chatbot, compile `SimpleChatBot.java` with Java and execute it in your preferred environment.

Comments throughout the code explain the functionality, making it easy to follow and understand the programming principles applied.
